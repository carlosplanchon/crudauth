    every byte typed, so the bcrypt comparison covers the whole password.

    Note:
        The actual password KDF is bcrypt (slow, salted, in [get_password_hash]

        fixed-width transform and is never stored or relied on for slowness. A

        that is a false positive, since the stored hash is bcrypt, not this
