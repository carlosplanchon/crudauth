    blindly lets an attacker forge a fresh IP per request and slip every per-IP
    rate limit and lockout. This function only consults the header when the app
    declares how many trusted proxies sit in front of it.

        request: The incoming request.
        trusted_hops: Number of trusted reverse proxies in front of the app.
            ``0`` (default) ignores forwarding headers entirely and uses the
            socket peer - correct when the app is directly exposed. ``N`` trusts
            the ``N`` right-most ``X-Forwarded-For`` entries as your proxies and
